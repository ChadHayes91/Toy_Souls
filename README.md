## Story Summary
The player is a child's toy whose owner has bought a new, secretly malicious toy (the antagonist) which perniciously plagues the minds of other toys. The antagonist, along with its possessed minions, continuously chases the player. The player will acquire skills and better gear throughout the adventure, culminating in a final showdown with this evil toy. However, the player will decide when it is time to eventually engage in combat, depending on how strong (or impatient) the player feels.
